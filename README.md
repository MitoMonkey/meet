A serverless, progressive web application (PWA) allowing users to  
* view a list of events
* search for a city and get a list of events hosted in that city
* view two charts - one that shows how many events will take place in that city on upcoming days, and another
that visualizes the popularity of event genres in the form of a pie chart.
